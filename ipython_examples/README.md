# Notebook Examples

* [Simple oscillator example solved with CVODE](./Simple Oscillator.ipynb)
* [Planar pendulum example solved with IDA](./Planar Pendulum as DAE.ipynb)
* [Double Pendulum](./Double Pendulum as DAE with roots.ipynb) Example of using classes to pass residual and jacobian functions to IDA, and of how to implement roots functionality.
* [Using Cython to Speed up CVODE](./Cython cvode speedup.ipynb) As SUNDIALS mostly uses internal C code, the benefits of using Cython for the right hand side are normally small.
* [Comparison of Different Solvers](./Performance tests.ipynb)
