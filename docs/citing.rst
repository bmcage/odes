Citing ODES
###########

If you use ODES as part of your research, can you please cite the
`ODES JOSS paper`_. A bibtex entry for the paper is below::

   @article{ODES,
     doi = {10.21105/joss.00165},
     url = {https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00165},
     year  = {2018},
     month = {feb},
     publisher = {The Open Journal},
     volume = {3},
     number = {22},
     pages = {165},
     author = {Benny Malengier and Pavol Ki{\v{s}}on and James Tocknell and Claas Abert and Florian Bruckner and Marc-Antonio Bisotti},
     title = {{ODES}: a high level interface to {ODE} and {DAE} solvers},
     journal = {The Journal of Open Source Software}
   }

Individual releases have
`DOIs on Zenodo <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.596566>`_,
which you can cite in addition to the
JOSS paper. Additionally, if you use one of the SUNDIALS solvers, we strongly
encourage you to cite the `SUNDIALS papers`_. Finally, ODES is built upon the
hard work of the numpy, scipy and Cython developers, we strongly
encourage you to `cite <https://www.scipy.org/citing.html>`_ them also.
