Welcome to the ODES scikit documentation!
=========================================

The ODES scikit provides access to Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers and Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE) solvers not included in `scipy`_. A convenience function :py:func:`scikits.odes.odeint.odeint` is available for fast and fire and forget integration. Object oriented class solvers :py:class:`scikits.odes.ode.ode` and :py:class:`scikits.odes.dae.dae` are available for fine control. Finally, the low levels solvers are also directly exposed for specialised needs.
