C
C  INFO(N):IN       This is an integer array used to communicate details
C                   of how the solution is to be carried out, such as
C                   tolerance type, matrix structure, step size and
C                   order limits, and choice of nonlinear system method.
C                   N must be at least 20.
C
C  RTOL,ATOL:INOUT  These quantities represent absolute and relative
C                   error tolerances (on local error) which you provide
C                   to indicate how accurately you wish the solution to
C                   be computed.  You may choose them to be both scalars
C                   or else both arrays of length NEQ.
C
C  IDID:OUT         This integer scalar is an indicator reporting what
C                   the code did.  You must monitor this variable to
C                   decide what action to take next.
C

C                   program and the RES, JAC, and PSOL subroutines.
C
C  JAC:EXT          This is the name of a subroutine which you may
C                   provide (optionally) for calculating Jacobian 
C                   (partial derivative) data involved in solving linear
C                   systems within DDASPK.
C
C  PSOL:EXT         This is the name of a subroutine which you must
C                   provide for solving linear systems if you selected
C                   a Krylov method.  The purpose of PSOL is to solve
C                   linear systems involving a left preconditioner P.
C
C *Overview
C
C  The DDASPK solver uses the backward differentiation formulas of
C  orders one through five to solve a system of the form G(t,y,y') = 0
C  for y = Y and y' = YPRIME.  Values for Y and YPRIME at the initial 
C  time must be given as input.  These values should be consistent, 
C  that is, if T, Y, YPRIME are the given initial values, they should 
C  satisfy G(T,Y,YPRIME) = 0.  However, if consistent values are not
C  known, in many cases you can have DDASPK solve for them -- see INFO(11).
C  (This and other options are described in more detail below.)
C
C  Normally, DDASPK solves the system from T to TOUT.  It is easy to
C  continue the solution to get results at additional TOUT.  This is
C  the interval mode of operation.  Intermediate results can also be
C  obtained easily by specifying INFO(3).
C
C  On each step taken by DDASPK, a sequence of nonlinear algebraic  
C  systems arises.  These are solved by one of two types of
C  methods:
C    * a Newton iteration with a direct method for the linear
C      systems involved (INFO(12) = 0), or
C    * a Newton iteration with a preconditioned Krylov iterative 
C      method for the linear systems involved (INFO(12) = 1).
C
C  The direct method choices are dense and band matrix solvers, 
C  with either a user-supplied or an internal difference quotient 
C  Jacobian matrix, as specified by INFO(5) and INFO(6).
C  In the band case, INFO(6) = 1, you must supply half-bandwidths
C  in IWORK(1) and IWORK(2).
C
C  The Krylov method is the Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRES) 
C  method, in either complete or incomplete form, and with 
C  scaling and preconditioning.  The method is implemented
C  in an algorithm called SPIGMR.  Certain options in the Krylov 
C  method case are specified by INFO(13) and INFO(15).
C
C  If the Krylov method is chosen, you may supply a pair of routines,
C  JAC and PSOL, to apply preconditioning to the linear system.
C  If the system is A*x = b, the matrix is A = dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME
C  (of order NEQ).  This system can then be preconditioned in the form
C  (P-inverse)*A*x = (P-inverse)*b, with left preconditioner P.
C  (DDASPK does not allow right preconditioning.)
C  Then the Krylov method is applied to this altered, but equivalent,
C  linear system, hopefully with much better performance than without
C  preconditioning.  (In addition, a diagonal scaling matrix based on
C  the tolerances is also introduced into the altered system.)
C
C  The JAC routine evaluates any data needed for solving systems
C  with coefficient matrix P, and PSOL carries out that solution.
C  In any case, in order to improve convergence, you should try to
C  make P approximate the matrix A as much as possible, while keeping
C  the system P*x = b reasonably easy and inexpensive to solve for x,
C  given a vector b.

C *Description
C
C------INPUT - WHAT TO DO ON THE FIRST CALL TO DDASPK-------------------
C
C
C  The first call of the code is defined to be the start of each new
C  problem.  Read through the descriptions of all the following items,
C  provide sufficient storage space for designated arrays, set
C  appropriate variables for the initialization of the problem, and
C  give information about how you want the problem to be solved.
C
C
C  RES -- Provide a subroutine of the form
C
C             SUBROUTINE RES (NEQ, T, Y, YPRIME, CJ, DELTA, IRES, RPAR, IPAR)
C
C         to define the system of differential/algebraic
C         equations which is to be solved. For the given values
C         of T, Y and YPRIME, the subroutine should return
C         the residual of the differential/algebraic system
C             DELTA = G(T,Y,YPRIME)
C         DELTA is a vector of length NEQ which is output from RES.
C         NEQ is not used, it is the dimension of Y, needed by f2py
C
C         Subroutine RES must not alter T, Y, YPRIME, or CJ.
C         You must declare the name RES in an EXTERNAL
C         statement in your program that calls DDASPK.
C         You must dimension Y, YPRIME, and DELTA in RES.
C
C         The input argument CJ can be ignored, or used to rescale
C         constraint equations in the system (see Ref. 2, p. 145).
C         Note: In this respect, DDASPK is not downward-compatible
C         with DDASSL, which does not have the RES argument CJ.
C
C         IRES is an integer flag which is always equal to zero
C         on input.  Subroutine RES should alter IRES only if it
C         encounters an illegal value of Y or a stop condition.
C         Set IRES = -1 if an input value is illegal, and DDASPK
C         will try to solve the problem without getting IRES = -1.
C         If IRES = -2, DDASPK will return control to the calling
C         program with IDID = -11.
C
C         RPAR and IPAR are real and integer parameter arrays which
C         you can use for communication between your calling program
C         and subroutine RES. They are not altered by DDASPK. If you
C         do not need RPAR or IPAR, ignore these parameters by treat-
C         ing them as dummy arguments. If you do choose to use them,
C         dimension them in your calling program and in RES as arrays
C         of appropriate length.
C
C  NEQ -- Set it to the number of equations in the system (NEQ .GE. 1).
C
C  T -- Set it to the initial point of the integration. (T must be
C       a variable.)
C
C  Y(*) -- Set this array to the initial values of the NEQ solution
C          components at the initial point.  You must dimension Y of
C          length at least NEQ in your calling program.
C
C  YPRIME(*) -- Set this array to the initial values of the NEQ first
C               derivatives of the solution components at the initial
C               point.  You must dimension YPRIME at least NEQ in your
C               calling program. 
C
C  TOUT - Set it to the first point at which a solution is desired.
C         You cannot take TOUT = T.  Integration either forward in T
C         (TOUT .GT. T) or backward in T (TOUT .LT. T) is permitted.
C
C         The code advances the solution from T to TOUT using step
C         sizes which are automatically selected so as to achieve the
C         desired accuracy.  If you wish, the code will return with the
C         solution and its derivative at intermediate steps (the
C         intermediate-output mode) so that you can monitor them,
C         but you still must provide TOUT in accord with the basic
C         aim of the code.
C
C         The first step taken by the code is a critical one because
C         it must reflect how fast the solution changes near the
C         initial point.  The code automatically selects an initial
C         step size which is practically always suitable for the
C         problem.  By using the fact that the code will not step past
C         TOUT in the first step, you could, if necessary, restrict the
C         length of the initial step.
C
C         For some problems it may not be permissible to integrate
C         past a point TSTOP, because a discontinuity occurs there
C         or the solution or its derivative is not defined beyond
C         TSTOP.  When you have declared a TSTOP point (see INFO(4)
C         and RWORK(1)), you have told the code not to integrate past
C         TSTOP.  In this case any tout beyond TSTOP is invalid input.
C
C  INFO(*) - Use the INFO array to give the code more details about
C            how you want your problem solved.  This array should be
C            dimensioned of length 20, though DDASPK uses only the 
C            first 15 entries.  You must respond to all of the following
C            items, which are arranged as questions.  The simplest use
C            of DDASPK corresponds to setting all entries of INFO to 0.
C
C       INFO(1) - This parameter enables the code to initialize itself.
C              You must set it to indicate the start of every new 
C              problem.
C
C          **** Is this the first call for this problem ...
C                yes - set INFO(1) = 0
C                 no - not applicable here.
C                      See below for continuation calls.  ****
C
C       INFO(2) - How much accuracy you want of your solution
C              is specified by the error tolerances RTOL and ATOL.
C              The simplest use is to take them both to be scalars.
C              To obtain more flexibility, they can both be arrays.
C              The code must be told your choice.
C
C          **** Are both error tolerances RTOL, ATOL scalars ...
C                yes - set INFO(2) = 0
C                      and input scalars for both RTOL and ATOL
C                 no - set INFO(2) = 1
C                      and input arrays for both RTOL and ATOL ****
C
C       INFO(3) - The code integrates from T in the direction of TOUT
C              by steps.  If you wish, it will return the computed
C              solution and derivative at the next intermediate step
C              (the intermediate-output mode) or TOUT, whichever comes
C              first.  This is a good way to proceed if you want to
C              see the behavior of the solution.  If you must have
C              solutions at a great many specific TOUT points, this
C              code will compute them efficiently.
C
C          **** Do you want the solution only at
C               TOUT (and not at the next intermediate step) ...
C                yes - set INFO(3) = 0
C                 no - set INFO(3) = 1 ****
C
C       INFO(4) - To handle solutions at a great many specific
C              values TOUT efficiently, this code may integrate past
C              TOUT and interpolate to obtain the result at TOUT.
C              Sometimes it is not possible to integrate beyond some
C              point TSTOP because the equation changes there or it is
C              not defined past TSTOP.  Then you must tell the code
C              this stop condition.
C
C           **** Can the integration be carried out without any
C                restrictions on the independent variable T ...
C                 yes - set INFO(4) = 0
C                  no - set INFO(4) = 1
C                       and define the stopping point TSTOP by
C                       setting RWORK(1) = TSTOP ****
C
C       INFO(5) - used only when INFO(12) = 0 (direct methods).
C              To solve differential/algebraic systems you may wish
C              to use a matrix of partial derivatives of the
C              system of differential equations.  If you do not
C              provide a subroutine to evaluate it analytically (see
C              description of the item JAC in the call list), it will
C              be approximated by numerical differencing in this code.
C              Although it is less trouble for you to have the code
C              compute partial derivatives by numerical differencing,
C              the solution will be more reliable if you provide the
C              derivatives via JAC.  Usually numerical differencing is
C              more costly than evaluating derivatives in JAC, but
C              sometimes it is not - this depends on your problem.
C
C           **** Do you want the code to evaluate the partial deriv-
C                atives automatically by numerical differences ...
C                 yes - set INFO(5) = 0
C                  no - set INFO(5) = 1
C                       and provide subroutine JAC for evaluating the
C                       matrix of partial derivatives ****
C
C       INFO(6) - used only when INFO(12) = 0 (direct methods).
C              DDASPK will perform much better if the matrix of
C              partial derivatives, dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME (here CJ is
C              a scalar determined by DDASPK), is banded and the code
C              is told this.  In this case, the storage needed will be
C              greatly reduced, numerical differencing will be performed
C              much cheaper, and a number of important algorithms will
C              execute much faster.  The differential equation is said 
C              to have half-bandwidths ML (lower) and MU (upper) if 
C              equation i involves only unknowns Y(j) with
C                             i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU .
C              For all i=1,2,...,NEQ.  Thus, ML and MU are the widths
C              of the lower and upper parts of the band, respectively,
C              with the main diagonal being excluded.  If you do not
C              indicate that the equation has a banded matrix of partial
C              derivatives the code works with a full matrix of NEQ**2
C              elements (stored in the conventional way).  Computations
C              with banded matrices cost less time and storage than with
C              full matrices if  2*ML+MU .lt. NEQ.  If you tell the
C              code that the matrix of partial derivatives has a banded
C              structure and you want to provide subroutine JAC to
C              compute the partial derivatives, then you must be careful
C              to store the elements of the matrix in the special form
C              indicated in the description of JAC.
C
C          **** Do you want to solve the problem using a full (dense)
C               matrix (and not a special banded structure) ...
C                yes - set INFO(6) = 0
C                 no - set INFO(6) = 1
C                       and provide the lower (ML) and upper (MU)
C                       bandwidths by setting
C                       IWORK(1)=ML
C                       IWORK(2)=MU ****
C
C       INFO(7) - You can specify a maximum (absolute value of)
C              stepsize, so that the code will avoid passing over very
C              large regions.
C
C          ****  Do you want the code to decide on its own the maximum
C                stepsize ...
C                 yes - set INFO(7) = 0
C                  no - set INFO(7) = 1
C                       and define HMAX by setting
C                       RWORK(2) = HMAX ****

C       INFO(8) -  Differential/algebraic problems may occasionally
C              suffer from severe scaling difficulties on the first
C              step.  If you know a great deal about the scaling of 
C              your problem, you can help to alleviate this problem 
C              by specifying an initial stepsize H0.

C       INFO(9) -  If storage is a severe problem, you can save some

C              The default value is 5.  For each order decrease below 5,
C              the code requires NEQ fewer locations, but it is likely 
C              to be slower.  In any case, you must have

C              (or nonpositive), it may help to set this
C              parameter.  There are three options that are
C              available:
C              1.  To have constraint checking only in the initial
C                  condition calculation.
C              2.  To enforce nonnegativity in Y during the integration.
C              3.  To enforce both options 1 and 2.
C
C              When selecting option 2 or 3, it is probably best to try the
C              code without using this option first, and only use
C              this option if that does not work very well.

C
C                  If you have specified INFO(10) = 1 or 3, then you
C                  will also need to identify how each component of Y
C                  in the initial condition calculation is constrained.
C                  You must set:
C                  IWORK(40+I) = +1 if Y(I) must be .GE. 0,
C                  IWORK(40+I) = +2 if Y(I) must be .GT. 0,

C                  IWORK(40+I) = -2 if Y(I) must be .LT. 0, while
C                  IWORK(40+I) =  0 if Y(I) is not constrained.
C
C       INFO(11) - DDASPK normally requires the initial T, Y, and
C              YPRIME to be consistent.  That is, you must have
C              G(T,Y,YPRIME) = 0 at the initial T.  If you do not know
C              the initial conditions precisely, in some cases
C              DDASPK may be able to compute it.
C
C              Denoting the differential variables in Y by Y_d
C              and the algebraic variables by Y_a, DDASPK can solve
C              one of two initialization problems:
C              1.  Given Y_d, calculate Y_a and Y'_d, or
C              2.  Given Y', calculate Y.
C              In either case, initial values for the given
C              components are input, and initial guesses for
C              the unknown components must also be provided as input.

C
C                  If you have specified INFO(11) = 1, then you
C                  will also need to identify  which are the
C                  differential and which are the algebraic
C                  components (algebraic components are components
C                  whose derivatives do not appear explicitly
C                  in the function G(T,Y,YPRIME)).  You must set:

C                  IWORK(LID+I) = -1 if Y(I) is an algebraic variable,
C                  where LID = 40 if INFO(10) = 0 or 2 and LID = 40+NEQ

C       INFO(12) - Except for the addition of the RES argument CJ,
C              DDASPK by default is downward-compatible with DDASSL,
C              which uses only direct (dense or band) methods to solve 
C              the linear systems involved.  You must set INFO(12) to
C              indicate whether you want the direct methods or the
C              Krylov iterative method.
C          ****   Do you want DDASPK to use standard direct methods
C                 (dense or band) or the Krylov (iterative) method ...
C                   direct methods - set INFO(12) = 0.
C                   Krylov method  - set INFO(12) = 1,
C                       and check the settings of INFO(13) and INFO(15).
C
C       INFO(13) - used when INFO(12) = 1 (Krylov methods).  
C              DDASPK uses scalars MAXL, KMP, NRMAX, and EPLI for the
C              iterative solution of linear systems.  INFO(13) allows 
C              you to override the default values of these parameters.  
C              These parameters and their defaults are as follows:
C              MAXL = maximum number of iterations in the SPIGMR 
C                 algorithm (MAXL .le. NEQ).  The default is 
C                 MAXL = MIN(5,NEQ).
C              KMP = number of vectors on which orthogonalization is 
C                 done in the SPIGMR algorithm.  The default is 
C                 KMP = MAXL, which corresponds to complete GMRES 
C                 iteration, as opposed to the incomplete form.  
C              NRMAX = maximum number of restarts of the SPIGMR 
C                 algorithm per nonlinear iteration.  The default is
C                 NRMAX = 5.
C              EPLI = convergence test constant in SPIGMR algorithm.
C                 The default is EPLI = 0.05.
C              Note that the length of RWORK depends on both MAXL 
C              and KMP.  See the definition of LRW below.
C          ****   Are MAXL, KMP, and EPLI to be given their

C                        IWORK(25) = KMP  (1 .le. KMP .le. MAXL)
C                        IWORK(26) = NRMAX  (NRMAX .ge. 0)

C
C        INFO(14) - used with INFO(11) > 0 (initial condition 
C               calculation is requested).  In this case, you may
C               request control to be returned to the calling program
C               immediately after the initial condition calculation,
C               before proceeding to the integration of the system
C               (e.g. to examine the computed Y and YPRIME).
C               If this is done, and if the initialization succeeded
C               (IDID = 4), you should reset INFO(11) to 0 for the
C               next call, to prevent the solver from repeating the 
C               initialization (and to avoid an infinite loop). 
C          ****   Do you want to proceed to the integration after
C                 the initial condition calculation is done ...
C                 yes - set INFO(14) = 0

C
C        INFO(15) - used when INFO(12) = 1 (Krylov methods).
C               When using preconditioning in the Krylov method,
C               you must supply a subroutine, PSOL, which solves the
C               associated linear systems using P.
C               The usage of DDASPK is simpler if PSOL can carry out
C               the solution without any prior calculation of data.
C               However, if some partial derivative data is to be
C               calculated in advance and used repeatedly in PSOL,
C               then you must supply a JAC routine to do this,
C               and set INFO(15) to indicate that JAC is to be called
C               for this purpose.  For example, P might be an
C               approximation to a part of the matrix A which can be
C               calculated and LU-factored for repeated solutions of
C               the preconditioner system.  The arrays WP and IWP
C               (described under JAC and PSOL) can be used to
C               communicate data between JAC and PSOL.
C          ****   Does PSOL operate with no prior preparation ...
C                 yes - set INFO(15) = 0 (no JAC routine)
C                  no - set INFO(15) = 1
C                       and supply a JAC routine to evaluate and
C                       preprocess any required Jacobian data.  ****

C                  no - set INFO(16) = 1
C                       If you have specified INFO(16) = 1, then you
C                       will also need to identify  which are the
C                       differential and which are the algebraic
C                       components (algebraic components are components
C                       whose derivatives do not appear explicitly
C                       in the function G(T,Y,YPRIME)).  You must set:
C                       IWORK(LID+I) = +1 if Y(I) is a differential 
C                                      variable, and

C                                      variable,
C                       where LID = 40 if INFO(10) = 0 or 2 and 
C                       LID = 40 + NEQ if INFO(10) = 1 or 3.
C
C       INFO(17) - used when INFO(11) > 0 (DDASPK is to do an 
C              initial condition calculation).
C              DDASPK uses several heuristic control quantities in the
C              initial condition calculation.  They have default values,
C              but can  also be set by the user using INFO(17).
C              These parameters and their defaults are as follows:
C              MXNIT  = maximum number of Newton iterations
C                 per Jacobian or preconditioner evaluation.
C                 The default is:
C                 MXNIT =  5 in the direct case (INFO(12) = 0), and
C                 MXNIT = 15 in the Krylov case (INFO(12) = 1).
C              MXNJ   = maximum number of Jacobian or preconditioner
C                 evaluations.  The default is:
C                 MXNJ = 6 in the direct case (INFO(12) = 0), and
C                 MXNJ = 2 in the Krylov case (INFO(12) = 1).
C              MXNH   = maximum number of values of the artificial
C                 stepsize parameter H to be tried if INFO(11) = 1.
C                 The default is MXNH = 5.
C                 NOTE: the maximum number of Newton iterations
C                 allowed in all is MXNIT*MXNJ*MXNH if INFO(11) = 1,
C                 and MXNIT*MXNJ if INFO(11) = 2.
C              LSOFF  = flag to turn off the linesearch algorithm
C                 (LSOFF = 0 means linesearch is on, LSOFF = 1 means
C                 it is turned off).  The default is LSOFF = 0.
C              STPTOL = minimum scaled step in linesearch algorithm.
C                 The default is STPTOL = (unit roundoff)**(2/3).
C              EPINIT = swing factor in the Newton iteration convergence
C                 test.  The test is applied to the residual vector,
C                 premultiplied by the approximate Jacobian (in the
C                 direct case) or the preconditioner (in the Krylov
C                 case).  For convergence, the weighted RMS norm of
C                 this vector (scaled by the error weights) must be
C                 less than EPINIT*EPCON, where EPCON = .33 is the
C                 analogous test constant used in the time steps.
C                 The default is EPINIT = .01.

C
C   RTOL, ATOL -- You must assign relative (RTOL) and absolute (ATOL)
C               error tolerances to tell the code how accurately you
C               want the solution to be computed.  They must be defined
C               as variables because the code may change them.
C               you have two choices --
C                     Both RTOL and ATOL are scalars (INFO(2) = 0), or
C                     both RTOL and ATOL are vectors (INFO(2) = 1).
C               In either case all components must be non-negative.
C
C               The tolerances are used by the code in a local error
C               test at each step which requires roughly that
C                        abs(local error in Y(i)) .le. EWT(i) ,
C               where EWT(i) = RTOL*abs(Y(i)) + ATOL is an error weight 
C               quantity, for each vector component.
C               (More specifically, a root-mean-square norm is used to
C               measure the size of vectors, and the error test uses the
C               magnitude of the solution at the beginning of the step.)
C
C               The true (global) error is the difference between the
C               true solution of the initial value problem and the
C               computed approximation.  Practically all present day
C               codes, including this one, control the local error at
C               each step and do not even attempt to control the global
C               error directly.
C
C               Usually, but not always, the true accuracy of
C               the computed Y is comparable to the error tolerances.
C               This code will usually, but not always, deliver a more
C               accurate solution if you reduce the tolerances and
C               integrate again.  By comparing two such solutions you 
C               can get a fairly reliable idea of the true error in the
C               solution at the larger tolerances.
C
C               Setting ATOL = 0. results in a pure relative error test
C               on that component.  Setting RTOL = 0. results in a pure
C               absolute error test on that component.  A mixed test
C               with non-zero RTOL and ATOL corresponds roughly to a
C               relative error test when the solution component is
C               much bigger than ATOL and to an absolute error test
C               when the solution component is smaller than the
C               threshold ATOL.
C
C               The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an

C  RWORK(*) -- a real work array, which should be dimensioned in your
C               calling program with a length equal to the value of
C               LRW (or greater).
C
C  LRW -- Set it to the declared length of the RWORK array.  The
C               minimum length depends on the options you have selected,
C               given by a base value plus additional storage as described
C               below.
C
C               If INFO(12) = 0 (standard direct method), the base value is
C               base = 50 + max(MAXORD+4,7)*NEQ.
C               The default value is MAXORD = 5 (see INFO(9)).  With the
C               default MAXORD, base = 50 + 9*NEQ.
C               Additional storage must be added to the base value for
C               any or all of the following options:
C                 if INFO(6) = 0 (dense matrix), add NEQ**2
C                 if INFO(6) = 1 (banded matrix), then

C                    if INFO(5) = 1, add (2*ML+MU+1)*NEQ,
C                 if INFO(16) = 1, add NEQ.
C
C              If INFO(12) = 1 (Krylov method), the base value is
C              base = 50 + (MAXORD+5)*NEQ + (MAXL+3+MIN0(1,MAXL-KMP))*NEQ +
C                      + (MAXL+3)*MAXL + 1 + LENWP.
C              See PSOL for description of LENWP.  The default values are:
C              MAXORD = 5 (see INFO(9)), MAXL = min(5,NEQ) and KMP = MAXL 
C              (see INFO(13)).
C              With the default values for MAXORD, MAXL and KMP,
C              base = 91 + 18*NEQ + LENWP.
C              Additional storage must be added to the base value for
C              any or all of the following options:
C                if INFO(16) = 1, add NEQ.
C
C
C  IWORK(*) -- an integer work array, which should be dimensioned in
C              your calling program with a length equal to the value
C              of LIW (or greater).
C
C  LIW -- Set it to the declared length of the IWORK array.  The
C             minimum length depends on the options you have selected,
C             given by a base value plus additional storage as described
C             below.
C
C             If INFO(12) = 0 (standard direct method), the base value is
C             base = 40 + NEQ.
C             IF INFO(10) = 1 or 3, add NEQ to the base value.
C             If INFO(11) = 1 or INFO(16) =1, add NEQ to the base value.
C
C             If INFO(12) = 1 (Krylov method), the base value is
C             base = 40 + LENIWP.
C             See PSOL for description of LENIWP.
C             IF INFO(10) = 1 or 3, add NEQ to the base value.
C             If INFO(11) = 1 or INFO(16) = 1, add NEQ to the base value.
C
C
C  RPAR, IPAR -- These are arrays of double precision and integer type,
C             respectively, which are available for you to use
C             for communication between your program that calls
C             DDASPK and the RES subroutine (and the JAC and PSOL
C             subroutines).  They are not altered by DDASPK.
C             If you do not need RPAR or IPAR, ignore these
C             parameters by treating them as dummy arguments.
C             If you do choose to use them, dimension them in
C             your calling program and in RES (and in JAC and PSOL)
C             as arrays of appropriate length.
C
C  JAC -- This is the name of a routine that you may supply
C         (optionally) that relates to the Jacobian matrix of the
C         nonlinear system that the code must solve at each T step.
C         The role of JAC (and its call sequence) depends on whether
C         a direct (INFO(12) = 0) or Krylov (INFO(12) = 1) method 
C         is selected.
C
C         **** INFO(12) = 0 (direct methods):
C           If you are letting the code generate partial derivatives
C           numerically (INFO(5) = 0), then JAC can be absent
C           (or perhaps a dummy routine to satisfy the loader).
C           Otherwise you must supply a JAC routine to compute
C           the matrix A = dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME.  It must have
C           the form
C
C           SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, YPRIME, PD, CJ, RPAR, IPAR)
C
C           The JAC routine must dimension Y, YPRIME, and PD (and RPAR
C           and IPAR if used).  CJ is a scalar which is input to JAC.
C           For the given values of T, Y, and YPRIME, the JAC routine
C           must evaluate the nonzero elements of the matrix A, and 
C           store these values in the array PD.  The elements of PD are 
C           set to zero before each call to JAC, so that only nonzero
C           elements need to be defined.
C           NEQ is not used, it is the dimension of Y, needed by f2py
C           The way you store the elements into the PD array depends
C           on the structure of the matrix indicated by INFO(6).
C           *** INFO(6) = 0 (full or dense matrix) ***
C               Give PD a first dimension of NEQ.  When you evaluate the
C               nonzero partial derivatives of equation i (i.e. of G(i))
C               with respect to component j (of Y and YPRIME), you must
C               store the element in PD according to
C                  PD(i,j) = dG(i)/dY(j) + CJ*dG(i)/dYPRIME(j).
C           *** INFO(6) = 1 (banded matrix with half-bandwidths ML, MU
C                            as described under INFO(6)) ***
C               Give PD a first dimension of 2*ML+MU+1.  When you 
C               evaluate the nonzero partial derivatives of equation i 
C               (i.e. of G(i)) with respect to component j (of Y and 
C               YPRIME), you must store the element in PD according to 
C                  IROW = i - j + ML + MU + 1
C                  PD(IROW,j) = dG(i)/dY(j) + CJ*dG(i)/dYPRIME(j).
C
C          **** INFO(12) = 1 (Krylov method):
C            If you are not calculating Jacobian data in advance for use
C            in PSOL (INFO(15) = 0), JAC can be absent (or perhaps a
C            dummy routine to satisfy the loader).  Otherwise, you may
C            supply a JAC routine to compute and preprocess any parts of
C            of the Jacobian matrix  A = dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME that are
C            involved in the preconditioner matrix P.
C            It is to have the form
C
C            SUBROUTINE JAC (RES, IRES, NEQ, T, Y, YPRIME, REWT, SAVR,
C                            WK, H, CJ, WP, IWP, IER, RPAR, IPAR)
C
C           The JAC routine must dimension Y, YPRIME, REWT, SAVR, WK,
C           and (if used) WP, IWP, RPAR, and IPAR.
C           The Y, YPRIME, and SAVR arrays contain the current values
C           of Y, YPRIME, and the residual G, respectively.  
C           The array WK is work space of length NEQ.  
C           H is the step size.  CJ is a scalar, input to JAC, that is
C           normally proportional to 1/H.  REWT is an array of 
C           reciprocal error weights, 1/EWT(i), where EWT(i) is
C           RTOL*abs(Y(i)) + ATOL (unless you supplied routine DDAWTS
C           instead), for use in JAC if needed.  For example, if JAC
C           computes difference quotient approximations to partial
C           derivatives, the REWT array may be useful in setting the
C           increments used.  The JAC routine should do any
C           factorization operations called for, in preparation for
C           solving linear systems in PSOL.  The matrix P should
C           be an approximation to the Jacobian,
C           A = dG/dY + CJ*dG/dYPRIME.
C
C           WP and IWP are real and integer work arrays which you may
C           use for communication between your JAC routine and your
C           PSOL routine.  These may be used to store elements of the 
C           preconditioner P, or related matrix data (such as factored
C           forms).  They are not altered by DDASPK.
C           If you do not need WP or IWP, ignore these parameters by
C           treating them as dummy arguments.  If you do use them,
C           dimension them appropriately in your JAC and PSOL routines.
C           See the PSOL description for instructions on setting 
C           the lengths of WP and IWP.
C
C           On return, JAC should set the error flag IER as follows..
C             IER = 0    if JAC was successful,
C             IER .ne. 0 if JAC was unsuccessful (e.g. if Y or YPRIME
C                        was illegal, or a singular matrix is found).
C           (If IER .ne. 0, a smaller stepsize will be tried.)
C           IER = 0 on entry to JAC, so need be reset only on a failure.
C           If RES is used within JAC, then a nonzero value of IRES will
C           override any nonzero value of IER (see the RES description).
C
C         Regardless of the method type, subroutine JAC must not
C         alter T, Y(*), YPRIME(*), H, CJ, or REWT(*).
C         You must declare the name JAC in an EXTERNAL statement in
C         your program that calls DDASPK.
C
C PSOL --  This is the name of a routine you must supply if you have
C         selected a Krylov method (INFO(12) = 1) with preconditioning.
C         In the direct case (INFO(12) = 0), PSOL can be absent 
C         (a dummy routine may have to be supplied to satisfy the 
C         loader).  Otherwise, you must provide a PSOL routine to 
C         solve linear systems arising from preconditioning.
C         When supplied with INFO(12) = 1, the PSOL routine is to 
C         have the form
C
C         SUBROUTINE PSOL (NEQ, T, Y, YPRIME, SAVR, WK, CJ, WGHT,
C                          WP, IWP, B, EPLIN, IER, RPAR, IPAR)
C
C         The PSOL routine must solve linear systems of the form 
C         P*x = b where P is the left preconditioner matrix.
C
C         The right-hand side vector b is in the B array on input, and
C         PSOL must return the solution vector x in B.
C         The Y, YPRIME, and SAVR arrays contain the current values
C         of Y, YPRIME, and the residual G, respectively.  
C
C         Work space required by JAC and/or PSOL, and space for data to
C         be communicated from JAC to PSOL is made available in the form
C         of arrays WP and IWP, which are parts of the RWORK and IWORK
C         arrays, respectively.  The lengths of these real and integer
C         work spaces WP and IWP must be supplied in LENWP and LENIWP,
C         respectively, as follows..
C           IWORK(27) = LENWP = length of real work space WP
C           IWORK(28) = LENIWP = length of integer work space IWP.
C
C         WK is a work array of length NEQ for use by PSOL.
C         CJ is a scalar, input to PSOL, that is normally proportional
C         to 1/H (H = stepsize).  If the old value of CJ
C         (at the time of the last JAC call) is needed, it must have
C         been saved by JAC in WP.
C
C         WGHT is an array of weights, to be used if PSOL uses an
C         iterative method and performs a convergence test.  (In terms
C         of the argument REWT to JAC, WGHT is REWT/sqrt(NEQ).)
C         If PSOL uses an iterative method, it should use EPLIN
C         (a heuristic parameter) as the bound on the weighted norm of
C         the residual for the computed solution.  Specifically, the
C         residual vector R should satisfy
C              SQRT (SUM ( (R(i)*WGHT(i))**2 ) ) .le. EPLIN
C
C         PSOL must not alter NEQ, T, Y, YPRIME, SAVR, CJ, WGHT, EPLIN.
C
C         On return, PSOL should set the error flag IER as follows..
C           IER = 0 if PSOL was successful,
C           IER .lt. 0 if an unrecoverable error occurred, meaning
C                 control will be passed to the calling routine,
C           IER .gt. 0 if a recoverable error occurred, meaning that
C                 the step will be retried with the same step size
C                 but with a call to JAC to update necessary data,
C                 unless the Jacobian data is current, in which case
C                 the step will be retried with a smaller step size.
C           IER = 0 on entry to PSOL so need be reset only on a failure.
C
C         You must declare the name PSOL in an EXTERNAL statement in
C         your program that calls DDASPK.
C
C
C  OPTIONALLY REPLACEABLE SUBROUTINE:
C
C  DDASPK uses a weighted root-mean-square norm to measure the 
C  size of various error vectors.  The weights used in this norm
C  are set in the following subroutine:
C
C    SUBROUTINE DDAWTS (NEQ, IWT, RTOL, ATOL, Y, EWT, RPAR, IPAR)
C    DIMENSION RTOL(*), ATOL(*), Y(*), EWT(*), RPAR(*), IPAR(*)
C
C  A DDAWTS routine has been included with DDASPK which sets the
C  weights according to
C    EWT(I) = RTOL*ABS(Y(I)) + ATOL
C  in the case of scalar tolerances (IWT = 0) or
C    EWT(I) = RTOL(I)*ABS(Y(I)) + ATOL(I)
C  in the case of array tolerances (IWT = 1).  (IWT is INFO(2).)
C  In some special cases, it may be appropriate for you to define
C  your own error weights by writing a subroutine DDAWTS to be 
C  called instead of the version supplied.  However, this should 
C  be attempted only after careful thought and consideration. 
C  If you supply this routine, you may use the tolerances and Y 
C  as appropriate, but do not overwrite these variables.  You
C  may also use RPAR and IPAR to communicate data as appropriate.
C  ***Note: Aside from the values of the weights, the choice of 
C  norm used in DDASPK (weighted root-mean-square) is not subject
C  to replacement by the user.  In this respect, DDASPK is not
C  downward-compatible with the original DDASSL solver (in which
C  the norm routine was optionally user-replaceable).
C
C
C------OUTPUT - AFTER ANY RETURN FROM DDASPK----------------------------
C
C  The principal aim of the code is to return a computed solution at
C  T = TOUT, although it is also possible to obtain intermediate
C  results along the way.  To find out whether the code achieved its
C  goal or if the integration process was interrupted before the task
C  was completed, you must check the IDID parameter.
C
C
C   T -- The output value of T is the point to which the solution
C        was successfully advanced.
C
C   Y(*) -- contains the computed solution approximation at T.
C
C   YPRIME(*) -- contains the computed derivative approximation at T.
C
C   IDID -- reports what the code did, described as follows:

C
C           IDID = 1 -- a step was successfully taken in the
C                   intermediate-output mode.  The code has not
C                   yet reached TOUT.
C
C           IDID = 2 -- the integration to TSTOP was successfully
C                   completed (T = TSTOP) by stepping exactly to TSTOP.
C
C           IDID = 3 -- the integration to TOUT was successfully
C                   completed (T = TOUT) by stepping past TOUT.
C                   Y(*) and YPRIME(*) are obtained by interpolation.
C
C           IDID = 4 -- the initial condition calculation, with
C                   INFO(11) > 0, was successful, and INFO(14) = 1.
C                   No integration steps were taken, and the solution
C                   is not considered to have been started.
C
C                    *** TASK INTERRUPTED ***
C                Reported by negative values of IDID
C
C           IDID = -1 -- a large amount of work has been expended
C                     (about 500 steps).
C
C           IDID = -2 -- the error tolerances are too stringent.
C
C           IDID = -3 -- the local error test cannot be satisfied
C                     because you specified a zero component in ATOL
C                     and the corresponding computed solution component
C                     is zero.  Thus, a pure relative error test is
C                     impossible for this component.
C
C           IDID = -5 -- there were repeated failures in the evaluation
C                     or processing of the preconditioner (in JAC).

C
C           IDID = -8 -- the matrix of partial derivatives appears

C                     failed to achieve convergence, and there were repeated

C
C   RTOL, ATOL -- these quantities remain unchanged except when

C                        from T if interpolation has been performed

C------INPUT - WHAT TO DO TO CONTINUE THE INTEGRATION  -----------------
C              (CALLS AFTER THE FIRST)
C
C     This code is organized so that subsequent calls to continue the
C     integration involve little (if any) additional effort on your
C     part.  You must monitor the IDID parameter in order to determine
C     what to do next.
C
C     Recalling that the principal task of the code is to integrate
C     from T to TOUT (the interval mode), usually all you will need
C     to do is specify a new TOUT upon reaching the current TOUT.
C
C     Do not alter any quantity not specifically permitted below.  In
C     particular do not alter NEQ, T, Y(*), YPRIME(*), RWORK(*), 
C     IWORK(*), or the differential equation in subroutine RES.  Any 
C     such alteration constitutes a new problem and must be treated 
C     as such, i.e. you must start afresh.
C
C     You cannot change from array to scalar error control or vice
C     versa (INFO(2)), but you can change the size of the entries of
C     RTOL or ATOL.  Increasing a tolerance makes the equation easier
C     to integrate.  Decreasing a tolerance will make the equation
C     harder to integrate and should generally be avoided.
C
C     You can switch from the intermediate-output mode to the
C     interval mode (INFO(3)) or vice versa at any time.
C
C     If it has been necessary to prevent the integration from going
C     past a point TSTOP (INFO(4), RWORK(1)), keep in mind that the
C     code will not integrate to any TOUT beyond the currently
C     specified TSTOP.  Once TSTOP has been reached, you must change
C     the value of TSTOP or set INFO(4) = 0.  You may change INFO(4)
C     or TSTOP at any time but you must supply the value of TSTOP in
C     RWORK(1) whenever you set INFO(4) = 1.
C
C     Do not change INFO(5), INFO(6), INFO(12-17) or their associated
C     IWORK/RWORK locations unless you are going to restart the code.
C
C                    *** FOLLOWING A COMPLETED TASK ***
C
C     If..
C     IDID = 1, call the code again to continue the integration
C                  another step in the direction of TOUT.
C
C     IDID = 2 or 3, define a new TOUT and call the code again.
C                  TOUT must be different from T.  You cannot change
C                  the direction of integration without restarting.
C
C     IDID = 4, reset INFO(11) = 0 and call the code again to begin
C                  the integration.  (If you leave INFO(11) > 0 and
C                  INFO(14) = 1, you may generate an infinite loop.)
C                  In this situation, the next call to DASPK is 
C                  considered to be the first call for the problem,
C                  in that all initializations are done.
C
C                    *** FOLLOWING AN INTERRUPTED TASK ***
C
C     To show the code that you realize the task was interrupted and
C     that you want to continue, you must take appropriate action and
C     set INFO(1) = 1.
C
C     If..
C     IDID = -1, the code has taken about 500 steps.  If you want to
C                  continue, set INFO(1) = 1 and call the code again.
C                  An additional 500 steps will be allowed.
C
C
C     IDID = -2, the error tolerances RTOL, ATOL have been increased
C                  to values the code estimates appropriate for
C                  continuing.  You may want to change them yourself.
C                  If you are sure you want to continue with relaxed
C                  error tolerances, set INFO(1) = 1 and call the code
C                  again.
C
C     IDID = -3, a solution component is zero and you set the
C                  corresponding component of ATOL to zero.  If you
C                  are sure you want to continue, you must first alter
C                  the error criterion to use positive values of ATOL 
C                  for those components corresponding to zero solution
C                  components, then set INFO(1) = 1 and call the code
C                  again.
C
C     IDID = -4  --- cannot occur with this code.
C
C     IDID = -5, your JAC routine failed with the Krylov method.  Check
C                  for errors in JAC and restart the integration.
C
C     IDID = -6, repeated error test failures occurred on the last
C                  attempted step in DDASPK.  A singularity in the
C                  solution may be present.  If you are absolutely
C                  certain you want to continue, you should restart
C                  the integration.  (Provide initial values of Y and
C                  YPRIME which are consistent.)
C
C     IDID = -7, repeated convergence test failures occurred on the last
C                  attempted step in DDASPK.  An inaccurate or ill-
C                  conditioned Jacobian or preconditioner may be the
C                  problem.  If you are absolutely certain you want
C                  to continue, you should restart the integration.
C
C
C     IDID = -8, the matrix of partial derivatives is singular, with
C                  the use of direct methods.  Some of your equations
C                  may be redundant.  DDASPK cannot solve the problem
C                  as stated.  It is possible that the redundant
C                  equations could be removed, and then DDASPK could
C                  solve the problem.  It is also possible that a
C                  solution to your problem either does not exist
C                  or is not unique.
C
C     IDID = -9, DDASPK had multiple convergence test failures, preceded
C                  by multiple error test failures, on the last
C                  attempted step.  It is possible that your problem is
C                  ill-posed and cannot be solved using this code.  Or,
C                  there may be a discontinuity or a singularity in the
C                  solution.  If you are absolutely certain you want to
C                  continue, you should restart the integration.
C
C     IDID = -10, DDASPK had multiple convergence test failures
C                  because IRES was equal to -1.  If you are
C                  absolutely certain you want to continue, you
C                  should restart the integration.
C
C     IDID = -11, there was an unrecoverable error (IRES = -2) from RES
C                  inside the nonlinear system solver.  Determine the
C                  cause before trying again.
C
C     IDID = -12, DDASPK failed to compute the initial Y and YPRIME
C                  vectors.  This could happen because the initial 
C                  approximation to Y or YPRIME was not very good, or
C                  because no consistent values of these vectors exist.
C                  The problem could also be caused by an inaccurate or
C                  singular iteration matrix, or a poor preconditioner.
C
C     IDID = -13, there was an unrecoverable error encountered inside 
C                  your PSOL routine.  Determine the cause before 
C                  trying again.
C
C     IDID = -14, the Krylov linear system solver failed to achieve
C                  convergence.  This may be due to ill-conditioning
C                  in the iteration matrix, or a singularity in the
C                  preconditioner (if one is being used).
C                  Another possibility is that there is a better
C                  choice of Krylov parameters (see INFO(13)).
C                  Possibly the failure is caused by redundant equations
C                  in the system, or by inconsistent equations.
C                  In that case, reformulate the system to make it
C                  consistent and non-redundant.
C
C     IDID = -15,..,-32 --- Cannot occur with this code.
C
C                       *** FOLLOWING A TERMINATED TASK ***
C
C     If IDID = -33, you cannot continue the solution of this problem.
C                  An attempt to do so will result in your run being
C                  terminated.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DDASIC is a driver routine to compute consistent initial values
C     for Y and YPRIME.  There are two different options:  
C     Denoting the differential variables in Y by Y_d, and
C     the algebraic variables by Y_a, the problem solved is either:
C     1.  Given Y_d, calculate Y_a and Y_d', or
C     2.  Given Y', calculate Y.
C     In either case, initial values for the given components
C     are input, and initial guesses for the unknown components
C     must also be provided as input.
C
C     The external routine NLSIC solves the resulting nonlinear system.
C
C     The parameters represent
C
C     X  --        Independent variable.
C     Y  --        Solution vector at X.
C     YPRIME --    Derivative of solution vector.
C     NEQ --       Number of equations to be integrated.
C     ICOPT     -- Flag indicating initial condition option chosen.
C                    ICOPT = 1 for option 1 above.
C                    ICOPT = 2 for option 2.
C     ID        -- Array of dimension NEQ, which must be initialized
C                  if option 1 is chosen.
C                    ID(i) = +1 if Y_i is a differential variable,
C                    ID(i) = -1 if Y_i is an algebraic variable.

C                  are used for communication between the
C                  calling program and external user routines.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DNEDD solves a nonlinear system of
C     algebraic equations of the form
C     G(X,Y,YPRIME) = 0 for the unknown Y.
C
C     The method used is a modified Newton scheme.
C
C     The parameters represent
C
C     X         -- Independent variable.
C     Y         -- Solution vector.
C     YPRIME    -- Derivative of solution vector.
C     NEQ       -- Number of unknowns.
C     RES       -- External user-supplied subroutine
C                  to evaluate the residual.  See RES description
C                  in DDASPK prologue.
C     JACD      -- External user-supplied routine to evaluate the
C                  Jacobian.  See JAC description for the case
C                  INFO(12) = 0 in the DDASPK prologue.
C     PDUM      -- Dummy argument.
C     H         -- Appropriate step size for next step.
C     WT        -- Vector of weights for error criterion.
C     JSTART    -- Indicates first call to this routine.
C                  If JSTART = 0, then this is the first call,
C                  otherwise it is not.
C     IDID      -- Completion flag, output by DNEDD.
C                  See IDID description in DDASPK prologue.
C     RPAR,IPAR -- Real and integer arrays used for communication
C                  between the calling program and external user
C                  routines.  They are not altered within DASPK.
C     PHI       -- Array of divided differences used by
C                  DNEDD.  The length is NEQ*(K+1),where
C                  K is the maximum order.
C     GAMMA     -- Array used to predict Y and YPRIME.  The length
C                  is MAXORD+1 where MAXORD is the maximum order.
C     DUMSVR    -- Dummy argument.
C     DELTA     -- Work vector for NLS of length NEQ.
C     E         -- Error accumulation vector for NLS of length NEQ.
C     WM,IWM    -- Real and integer arrays storing
C                  matrix information such as the matrix
C                  of partial derivatives, permutation
C                  vector, and various other information.
C     CJ        -- Parameter always proportional to 1/H.
C     CJOLD     -- Saves the value of CJ as of the last call to DMATD.
C                  Accounts for changes in CJ needed to
C                  decide whether to call DMATD.
C     CJLAST    -- Previous value of CJ.
C     S         -- A scalar determined by the approximate rate
C                  of convergence of the Newton iteration and used
C                  in the convergence test for the Newton iteration.
C
C                  If RATE is defined to be an estimate of the
C                  rate of convergence of the Newton iteration,
C                  then S = RATE/(1.D0-RATE).
C
C                  The closer RATE is to 0., the faster the Newton
C                  iteration is converging; the closer RATE is to 1.,
C                  the slower the Newton iteration is converging.
C
C                  On the first Newton iteration with an up-dated
C                  preconditioner S = 100.D0, Thus the initial
C                  RATE of convergence is approximately 1.
C
C                  S is preserved from call to call so that the rate
C                  estimate from a previous step can be applied to
C                  the current step.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DNSD solves a nonlinear system of
C     algebraic equations of the form
C     G(X,Y,YPRIME) = 0 for the unknown Y.
C
C     The method used is a modified Newton scheme.
C
C     The parameters represent
C
C     X         -- Independent variable.
C     Y         -- Solution vector.
C     YPRIME    -- Derivative of solution vector.
C     NEQ       -- Number of unknowns.
C     RES       -- External user-supplied subroutine
C                  to evaluate the residual.  See RES description
C                  in DDASPK prologue.
C     PDUM      -- Dummy argument.
C     WT        -- Vector of weights for error criterion.

C                  between the calling program and external user
C                  routines.  They are not altered within DASPK.
C     DUMSVR    -- Dummy argument.
C     DELTA     -- Work vector for DNSD of length NEQ.

C                  matrix information such as the matrix
C                  of partial derivatives, permutation
C                  vector, and various other information.
C     CJ        -- Parameter always proportional to 1/H (step size).
C     DUMS      -- Dummy argument.

C                  In the Newton iteration: S = RATE/(1 - RATE),
C                  where RATE is the estimated rate of convergence
C                  of the Newton iteration.
C                  The calling routine passes the initial value
C                  of S to the Newton iteration.

C                  DELTA by CONFAC.
C                  0  ==> do not scale DELTA by CONFAC.
C                  1  ==> scale DELTA by CONFAC.
C     MAXIT     -- Maximum allowed number of Newton iterations.
C     IRES      -- Error flag returned from RES.  See RES description
C                  in DDASPK prologue.  If IRES = -1, then IERNEW
C                  will be set to 1.
C                  If IRES < -1, then IERNEW will be set to -1.
C     IDUM      -- Dummy argument.
C     IERNEW    -- Error flag for Newton iteration.
C                   0  ==> Newton iteration converged.
C                   1  ==> recoverable error inside Newton iteration.
C                  -1  ==> unrecoverable error inside Newton iteration.
C
C     All arguments with "DUM" in their names are dummy arguments
C     which are not used in this routine.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     This routine computes the iteration matrix
C     J = dG/dY+CJ*dG/dYPRIME (where G(X,Y,YPRIME)=0).
C     Here J is computed by:
C       the user-supplied routine JACD if IWM(MTYPE) is 1 or 4, or
C       by numerical difference quotients if IWM(MTYPE) is 2 or 5.
C
C     The parameters have the following meanings.
C     X        = Independent variable.
C     Y        = Array containing predicted values.
C     YPRIME   = Array containing predicted derivatives.
C     DELTA    = Residual evaluated at (X,Y,YPRIME).
C                (Used only if IWM(MTYPE)=2 or 5).
C     CJ       = Scalar parameter defining iteration matrix.
C     H        = Current stepsize in integration.
C     IER      = Variable which is .NE. 0 if iteration matrix
C                is singular, and 0 otherwise.
C     EWT      = Vector of error weights for computing norms.
C     E        = Work space (temporary) of length NEQ.
C     WM       = Real work space for matrices.  On output
C                it contains the LU decomposition
C                of the iteration matrix.
C     IWM      = Integer work space containing
C                matrix information.
C     RES      = External user-supplied subroutine
C                to evaluate the residual.  See RES description
C                in DDASPK prologue.
C     IRES     = Flag which is equal to zero if no illegal values
C                in RES, and less than zero otherwise.  (If IRES
C                is less than zero, the matrix was not completed).
C                In this case (if IRES .LT. 0), then IER = 0.
C     UROUND   = The unit roundoff error of the machine being used.
C     JACD     = Name of the external user-supplied routine
C                to evaluate the iteration matrix.  (This routine
C                is only used if IWM(MTYPE) is 1 or 4)
C                See JAC description for the case INFO(12) = 0
C                in DDASPK prologue.
C     RPAR,IPAR= Real and integer parameter arrays that
C                are used for communication between the
C                calling program and external user routines.
C                They are not altered by DMATD.

C
C     DNSIK solves a nonlinear system of algebraic equations of the
C     form G(X,Y,YPRIME) = 0 for the unknown parts of Y and YPRIME in
C     the initial conditions.
C
C     The method used is a Newton scheme combined with a linesearch
C     algorithm, using Krylov iterative linear system methods.
C
C     The parameters represent

C
C     DLINSK uses a linesearch algorithm to calculate a new (Y,YPRIME)

C
C     f(YNEW,YPNEW) .le. (1 - 2*ALPHA*RL)*f(Y,YPRIME)
C
C     where 0 < RL <= 1, and RHOK is the scaled preconditioned norm of
C     the final residual vector in the Krylov iteration.  
C     Here, f(y,y') is defined as
C
C      f(y,y') = (1/2)*norm( (P-inverse)*G(t,y,y') )**2 ,
C
C     where norm() is the weighted RMS vector norm, G is the DAE
C     system residual function, and P is the preconditioner used
C     in the Krylov iteration.
C
C     In addition to the parameters defined elsewhere, we have

C     R       -- Work space length NEQ for residual vector.
C     IRET    -- Return flag.
C                IRET=0 means that a satisfactory (Y,YPRIME) was found.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     DNEDK solves a nonlinear system of
C     algebraic equations of the form
C     G(X,Y,YPRIME) = 0 for the unknown Y.
C
C     The method used is a matrix-free Newton scheme.
C
C     The parameters represent
C     X         -- Independent variable.
C     Y         -- Solution vector at x.
C     YPRIME    -- Derivative of solution vector
C                  after successful step.
C     NEQ       -- Number of equations to be integrated.
C     RES       -- External user-supplied subroutine
C                  to evaluate the residual.  See RES description
C                  in DDASPK prologue.
C     JACK     --  External user-supplied routine to update
C                  the preconditioner.  (This is optional).
C                  See JAC description for the case
C                  INFO(12) = 1 in the DDASPK prologue.
C     PSOL      -- External user-supplied routine to solve
C                  a linear system using preconditioning. 
C                  (This is optional).  See explanation inside DDASPK.
C     H         -- Appropriate step size for this step.
C     WT        -- Vector of weights for error criterion.
C     JSTART    -- Indicates first call to this routine.
C                  If JSTART = 0, then this is the first call,
C                  otherwise it is not.
C     IDID      -- Completion flag, output by DNEDK.
C                  See IDID description in DDASPK prologue.
C     RPAR,IPAR -- Real and integer arrays used for communication
C                  between the calling program and external user
C                  routines.  They are not altered within DASPK.
C     PHI       -- Array of divided differences used by

C                  K is the maximum order.
C     GAMMA     -- Array used to predict Y and YPRIME.  The length
C                  is K+1, where K is the maximum order.
C     SAVR      -- Work vector for DNEDK of length NEQ.
C     DELTA     -- Work vector for DNEDK of length NEQ.
C     E         -- Error accumulation vector for DNEDK of length NEQ.
C     WM,IWM    -- Real and integer arrays storing
C                  matrix information for linear system
C                  solvers, and various other information.
C     CJ        -- Parameter always proportional to 1/H.
C     CJOLD     -- Saves the value of CJ as of the last call to DITMD.
C                  Accounts for changes in CJ needed to
C                  decide whether to call DITMD.
C     CJLAST    -- Previous value of CJ.
C     S         -- A scalar determined by the approximate rate
C                  of convergence of the Newton iteration and used
C                  in the convergence test for the Newton iteration.
C
C                  If RATE is defined to be an estimate of the
C                  rate of convergence of the Newton iteration,
C                  then S = RATE/(1.D0-RATE).
C
C                  The closer RATE is to 0., the faster the Newton
C                  iteration is converging; the closer RATE is to 1.,
C                  the slower the Newton iteration is converging.
C
C                  On the first Newton iteration with an up-dated
C                  preconditioner S = 100.D0, Thus the initial
C                  RATE of convergence is approximately 1.
C
C                  S is preserved from call to call so that the rate
C                  estimate from a previous step can be applied to
C                  the current step.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C DSLVK uses a restart algorithm and interfaces to DSPIGM for
C the solution of the linear system arising from a Newton iteration.
C
C In addition to variables described elsewhere,
C communication with DSLVK uses the following variables..
C WM    = Real work space containing data for the algorithm
C         (Krylov basis vectors, Hessenberg matrix, etc.).
C IWM   = Integer work space containing data for the algorithm.
C X     = The right-hand side vector on input, and the solution vector
C         on output, of length NEQ.
C IRES  = Error flag from RES.
C IERSL = Output flag ..
C         IERSL =  0 means no trouble occurred (or user RES routine
C                    returned IRES < 0)
C         IERSL =  1 means the iterative method failed to converge
C                    (DSPIGM returned IFLAG > 0.)
C         IERSL = -1 means there was a nonrecoverable error in the
C                    iterative solver, and an error exit will occur.

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C This routine solves the linear system A * Z = R using a scaled
C preconditioned version of the generalized minimum residual method.
C An initial guess of Z = 0 is assumed.
C
C      On entry
C
C          NEQ = Problem size, passed to PSOL.
C
C           TN = Current Value of T.
C
C            Y = Array Containing current dependent variable vector.
C
C       YPRIME = Array Containing current first derivative of Y.
C
C         SAVR = Array containing current value of G(T,Y,YPRIME).
C
C            R = The right hand side of the system A*Z = R.
C                R is also used as work space when computing
C                the final approximation and will therefore be
C                destroyed.
C                (R is the same as V(*,MAXL+1) in the call to DSPIGM.)
C
C         WGHT = The vector of length NEQ containing the nonzero
C                elements of the diagonal scaling matrix.
C
C         MAXL = The maximum allowable order of the matrix H.
C
C       MAXLP1 = MAXL + 1, used for dynamic dimensioning of HES.
C
C          KMP = The number of previous vectors the new vector, VNEW,
C                must be made orthogonal to.  (KMP .LE. MAXL.)
C
C        EPLIN = Tolerance on residuals R-A*Z in weighted rms norm.
C
C           CJ = Scalar proportional to current value of 
C                1/(step size H).
C
C           WK = Real work array used by routine DATV and PSOL.
C
C           DL = Real work array used for calculation of the residual
C                norm RHO when the method is incomplete (KMP.LT.MAXL)
C                and/or when using restarting.
C
C           WP = Real work array used by preconditioner PSOL.
C
C          IWP = Integer work array used by preconditioner PSOL.
C
C         IRST = Method flag indicating if restarting is being
C                performed.  IRST .GT. 0 means restarting is active,
C                while IRST = 0 means restarting is not being used.
C
C        NRSTS = Counter for the number of restarts on the current
C                call to DSPIGM.  If NRSTS .GT. 0, then the residual
C                R is already scaled, and so scaling of R is not
C                necessary.
C
C
C      On Return
C
C         Z    = The final computed approximation to the solution
C                of the system A*Z = R.
C
C         LGMR = The number of iterations performed and
C                the current order of the upper Hessenberg
C                matrix HES.
C
C         NRE  = The number of calls to RES (i.e. DATV)
C
C         NPSL = The number of calls to PSOL.
C
C         V    = The neq by (LGMR+1) array containing the LGMR
C                orthogonal vectors V(*,1) to V(*,LGMR).
C
C         HES  = The upper triangular factor of the QR decomposition
C                of the (LGMR+1) by LGMR upper Hessenberg matrix whose
C                entries are the scaled inner-products of A*V(*,I)
C                and V(*,K).
C
C         Q    = Real array of length 2*MAXL containing the components
C                of the givens rotations used in the QR decomposition
C                of HES.  It is loaded in DHEQR and used in DHELS.
C
C         IRES = Error flag from RES.
C
C           DL = Scaled preconditioned residual, 
C                (D-inverse)*(P-inverse)*(R-A*Z). Only loaded when
C                performing restarts of the Krylov iteration.
C
C         RHOK = Weighted norm of final preconditioned residual.
C
C        IFLAG = Integer error flag..
C                0 Means convergence in LGMR iterations, LGMR.LE.MAXL.
C                1 Means the convergence test did not pass in MAXL
C                  iterations, but the new residual norm (RHO) is
C                  .LT. the old residual norm (RNRM), and so Z is
C                  computed.
C                2 Means the convergence test did not pass in MAXL
C                  iterations, new residual norm (RHO) .GE. old residual
C                  norm (RNRM), and the initial guess, Z = 0, is
C                  returned.
C                3 Means there was a recoverable error in PSOL
C                  caused by the preconditioner being out of date.
C               -1 Means there was an unrecoverable error in PSOL.
