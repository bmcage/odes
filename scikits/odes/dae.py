First-order DAE solver
======================

User-friendly interface to various numerical integrators for solving an
algebraic system of first order ODEs with prescribed initial conditions:

.. math::
    A \frac{dy(t)}{dt} = f(t,y(t)),

    y(t=0)[i] = y0[i],

    \frac{d y(t=0)}{dt}[i]  = yprime0[i],

where :math:`i = 0, ..., len(y0) - 1`; :math:`A` is a (possibly singular) matrix
of size :math:`i Ã— i`; and :math:`f(t,y)` is a vector of size :math:`i` or more generally, equations of the form

.. math::
    G(t,y,y') = 0

class dae(object):
    """
    A generic interface class to differential algebraic equations.

    Define equation res = G(t,y,y') which can eg be G = f(y,t) - A y' when solving A y' = f(y,t), and where (optional) jac is the jacobian matrix of the nonlinear system see fortran source code), so d res/dy + scaling * d res/dy' or d res/dy depending on the backend.

    Parameters
    ----------
    integrator_name : ``'ida'``, ``'ddaspk'`` or ``'lsodi'``
        The integrator solver to use.

    eqsres : residual function
        Residual of the DAE. The signature of this function depends on the
        solver used, see the solver documentation for details.
        Generally however, you can assume the following signature to work:

            ``eqsres(x, y, yprime, return_residual)``

        with
        x       : independent variable, eg the time, float
        y       : array of n unknowns in x
        yprime  : dy/dx array of n unknowns in x, dimension = dim(y)
        return_residual: array that must be updated with the value of the residuals, so G(t,y,y').  The dimension is equal to dim(y)
        return value: integer, 0 for success. It is not guaranteed that a solver takes this status into account

        Some solvers will allow userdata to be passed to eqsres, or optional
        formats that are more performant.

    options : mapping
        Additional options for initialization, solver dependent
        See set_options method of the `integrator_name` you selected for
        details.

    As an easy example, consider the simple oscillator, which we write as
    G(y,y',t) = 0 instead of the normal ode, and solve as a DAE.
